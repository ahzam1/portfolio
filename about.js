  "about":"I am an international student currently studying at the University of Alberta and am enduring my 4th year of Computer Science. I am Pakistani, but was born and raised in Brunei. (Un)fortunately for me, I am interested in a wide variety of subjects both within Computer Science and outside of it. <br/><br/>I have been playing the guitar for 5 years now, and started using FL Studio 20 for live recording and editing. One of my main interests is video games, focusing around common competitive games such as MOBAs/FPSs because I'm addicted to competition. I also enjoy playing MMORPGS such as Warframe, GW:2 and Dauntless.<br/> <br/> With this set of skills and interests, I really hope to be the all-rounder that your team needs!",
